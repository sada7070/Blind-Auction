# Blind-Auction
In this python program, we can bid blindly without knowing others bidding. We will provide our name, and bidding amount as input and if there any other users the screen will be cleared and it will be continued. And atlast however bid the heighest will win the contest.

*****IMPORTANT*****
In this program we used "CLEAR" function to clear the screen. This function is imported from "REPLIT" hence "THIS CODE WILL ONLY RUN IN REPLIT IDE"
